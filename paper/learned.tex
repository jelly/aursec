\subsubsection*{Ethereum-Solidity}
\subsubsection*{JSON RPC}
The JSON PRC is used by the aursec-ethereum-blockchain for remote access to the block. Methods can be called or transactions can be sent by sending a JSON-Object to the block chain. The answer from the block chain is also always a JSON-Object. One big advantage is the easy parsing from and to JSON-Objects both in Bash and Python. The best example is visible in the code of aursec-tui (\ref{sec:tui}).
\subsubsection*{Bash}
\subsubsection*{Python-Urwid}
Urwid is a \emph{Terminal User Interface} (TUI) library for Python. It provides ready-made widgets which make it easy to create structured user interfaces.
