\subsubsection*{Ethereum-Solidity}
\subsubsection*{Json-RPC}
The JSON-PRC is used by the aursec-ethereum-blockchain for remote access to the block. Methods can be called or transactions can be sent by sending a JSON-Object to the block chain. The answer from the block chain is also always a JSON-Object. One big advantage is the easy parsing from and into JSON-Objects. The best example is visible in the code of aursec-tui (\ref{sec:tui}).
\subsubsection*{Bash}
\subsubsection*{Python-Urwid}
Urwid is a terminal user interfaces (tui) library for python. It enables possibilities to structure the tui really easy by the different widgets.
