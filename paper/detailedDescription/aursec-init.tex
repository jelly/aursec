\subsubsection{aursec-init}
Aursec-init is a shellscript which allows the user to create all requirements just by running it. It also allows to overwrite an existing aursec-blockchain with a new one.

% TODO add refs
\paragraph*{workflow of the initialization:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Creating needed folders and markers (markers are needed by TODO) and set the right rights.
	\item Creating the blockchain based on a genesis-block.
	\item Creating a new user with a random password which is saved in a file.
	\item Creating the DAG, which is a ~1GB dataset. The DAG is needed for mining the blocks. \cite{wiki:DAG}
	\item Mine a few blocks to have enough ether to be able to commit a few hashes at the start.
\end{enumerate}
