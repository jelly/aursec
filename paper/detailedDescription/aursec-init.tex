\subsubsection{aursec-init}
Aursec-init is a shellscript which allows the user to create all requirements just by running it. It also allows to overwrite an existing aursec-blockchain with a new one.

\paragraph*{workflow of the initialization:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create needed folders and markers (markers are needed by TODO)
	\item Create the blockchain from our genesis block.
	\item Create a new user with a random password which is saved in a file.
	\item Create the \emph{Directed Acyclic Graph} for the blockchain, which is a ~1GB dataset. The DAG is needed for mining new blocks. \cite{wiki:DAG}
	\item Set safe permissions for the above files and folders.
	\item Mine a few blocks to trigger the synchronization and to have enough currency (ether) to be able to commit a few hashes from the start.
\end{enumerate}
