\label{sec:tui} % TODO: Mention which TUI library you used!
\texttt{aursec-tui} is a Python script. The TUI gives a overview over all mined blocks, their hashes, the miner of the block and eventual transactions which are saved in the block.

It is split in two parts. The first part is needed to gain the data from the blockchain and save it, the other part formats the information and displays it. To display the results as fast as possible a thread searches the blockchain in the background. Any additional data will be displayed after the next refresh. The script offers the user two settings for filtering the results.
\begin{itemize}
	% TODO: während ich das lese fällt mir auf, dass du die Optionen umbenennen solltest :)
	\item \texttt{only mine:} only display blocks which where mined by the user himself.
	\item \texttt{only transactions:} only display blocks with transactions.
\end{itemize}
The settings can be combined with the result that all blocks mined by the user with transactions will be displayed.
